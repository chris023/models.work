## Intro
This PWA (Progressive Web App) is a multi-platform staffing application designed to bring together models looking for work and businesses looking to hire models for temporary work.  Goals for this project included utilizing a scaleable design and one which was modular enough to allow easily utilizing the same codebase to extend into other industries and be rebranded.
